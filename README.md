##Welcome to IBM Data Science Experience (DSX) - datascience.ibm.com

IBM Data Science Experience (DSX) is the premier offering that seamlessly allows data scientists and data engineers to connect data from multiple domains, to analyze it, and visually to explore the data for insights. The solutions that were not possible previously or required months of development effort can now be done in DSX in a very fast and intuitive manner.

R has become the de-facto standard in the domain of data science: it supports multiple machine learning algorithms and ability to visualize the outcomes of the research.

DSX brings together the data science development experience accumulated in R, Python, Scala, and Java, intuitive data connectivity and processing capabilities of Spark, and the state-of-art dynamic visualization technology using Brunel, Pixiedust, and RStudio.
